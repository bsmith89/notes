Multidimensional, continuous Markov-like model

Consider how the distances between points in multidimensional space
change with time.
Basically, I want to see a Markov model of points moving between states,
but where the states are continuous, not discrete.
Can we assign rates to movement in multidimensional space, potentially
including which axes movement occurs over.
