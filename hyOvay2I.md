Various Project Ideas

## Research
-   Multidimensional, continuous Markov-like model

    Consider how the distances between points in multidimensional space
    change with time.
    Basically, I want to see a Markov model of points moving between states,
    but where the states are continuous, not discrete.
    Can we assign rates to movement in multidimensional space, potentially
    including which axes movement occurs over.

## Coding

-   Markdown-diff (like latexdiff)
-   Rules of Makefiles
    -   Don't name two different steps with the same name (don't give files the same
        suffix/infix for different transformations)
    -   If you're using a bunch of semi-colons, you should
        probably split it out into a script.
-   Pandoc Hacks
    -   Preprocessing Pandoc Input:
        -   See <http://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/gpp.html>
    -   Multiple YAML blocks can be defined, and blocks can be in separate files.
        -   (?) Mutliply defined variables, first or last definition sticks?
    -   Is there a way to swap HTML codes for LaTeX symbols?
-   Neomake
