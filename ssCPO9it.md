### Session 1 - Shell ###

#### Bad ####

-   Beginning was very slow
-   Just the visualizing of the current directory on the big screen [referring to not knowing what dir the instructor was in at all times]
-   Maybe a handout with unix terms: rm, cp ...
-   Frustrating that some things don't work on windows
-   have us give you nods if we are following
-   Maybe just check in if people are following
-   It may (or may not) be useful to have larger scripts taht we just look at and/or modify
-   Very slow progression
-   Diversity in knowledge forces the workshop to go slower but it's necessary
-   Wish we could go over bash profile issues
-   maybe another exercise or two on our own or with neighbors
-   started a bit slow, and really looking foward to python
-   started a bit slow
-   [just a dash]
-   It may be helpful to leve the scipt up while we're looking at the website on the screen
-   could go a little faster

#### Good ####

-   I like the examples which show functionality e.g. making a backup script
-   like the interaction between teacher & students
-   practical exercises
-   good pace - good examples
-   clear explanation of pipeline scripting
-   Thought the pace you kept was excellent and your descriptions were very clear -Thanks
-   This was a good level for beginners
-   Very good for people that don't know anything of programming & coding
-   Good pace, thanks for taking questions on the fly
-   helpful side comments
-   Some good UNIX basics presented
-   Great simple explanations!
-   Useful tips
-   good pace
-   reminded of basics I need to know & learned a lot of new commands have the basics to [unclear]
-   great to see how to build scripts from the beginning, very easy to follow
-   I like learning the bash command

### Session 2 - Python I ###

#### Bad ####

-   It would be nice to go over a pre-written, more complicated code to discuss and/or modify it
-   Just so much to learn (nothing bad!)
-   Send out a copy of your notebook, pls.
-   The python portion went a little too fast and the screen usually wasn't showing the step I was on
-   Maybe send out a copy of the notebook
-   More explanation of actual files/folders/path associated with python
-   it would be nice mix some bash and python script. very useful workshop! thanks
-   tell group little command you use without noticing e.g. ^m-b (time permitting)
-   a bigger screen would be helpful to see more commands on the screen at once
-   too fast paced for me - a newbie!

#### Good ####

-   good work!
-   I like the class (approach & structure) overall
-   good lesson - predict answer before running
-   Great explanations
-   awesome, just want more time with it
-   really cool stuff!
-   never used python so I learned a lot of new info
-   Loved using IPython
-   The questions were answered quickly
-   great speed

### Session 3 - Git ###

#### Bad ####

-   I work with proprietary data format: so I can't use open github :(
-   didn't use git reset
-   difficult to follow, I think because git is not as intuitive as python
-   It would have been nice to see ways that Git relates to real projects.  I had trouble seeing how it would be useful.
-   - Very usefull to share and edit documents.  - Would be good to know how to do it with .m files
-   Just need more time and try more problems
-   Try not to use "alias" [referring to some git aliases Ivan had set up]
-   Now I want margaritas in the afternoon [referring to Ivan's guacamole recipe example]
-   It would be nice to: - Ask us to download only files that we need  - if possible have the command prompt on one half of the screen or a separate screen at all times
-   It would be nice to get nano or something similar working on PCs

#### Good ####

-   Chalk board work helped!  Nice progression through material.
-   The lesson went at a good speed.
-   Looking forward to using git+github
-   Great into to Git.  Goood to have problems to do in class.
-   Pace was great.
-   Very nice!
-   Having the etherpad support + notes is really helpful!
-   Such a powerful program and very good intro
-   Very informative and could follow for the most part never having worked with Git before.
-   Iangagnon [a name?] really useful stuff
-   I like the independent small challenges
-   Keep the workshop as is (more or less).  Good [stuff?] overall.

### Session 4 - Python II ###

#### Bad ####

-   [a dash]
-   Just a lot of information
-   extend both days by 30 min to get more time for last session
-   Consider doing the project differently.  Maybe you can have a pre-written code in spyder?  Too many commands presented without explanation of what exactly they do.  I wish there was more on making "pretty" plots with axes, legends, error bars, etc.
-   The ultimate goal of the challenge questions could be explained better so know what we're trying to do

#### Good ####

-   The workship covered a good range of useful things
-   Thanks!  I learned a ton.
-   nice workshop
-   good job! Thank you.
-   Excellent, applicable examples!
-   Great way to put it together
-   awesome exposure to useful programs
