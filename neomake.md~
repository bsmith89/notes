Specifications for a new-age Make

-   Simple syntax, similar to Make
    -   (?) YAML
        -   Alternatively, make a full-featured YAML syntax and
            translate a simpler DSL to YAML
-   Clear rules for execution
-   Easy debugging
    -   Tell me when something is ambiguous
    -   Tell me when two recipes _could_ apply, even when there
        are precedence rules
-   Plugins to run recipes using other systems (e.g. Torque)
-   Error recovery
-   Arbitrary regex in targets, expanded groups in pre-requisites and recipes
-   Smart parallelization
-   Modularity (include other files)
-   Flexible up-to-date-ness checking
    -   Plugins
    -   Arbitrary checking defined per-target
-   Easy to read verbosity
-   Single-file build specification
-   (?) can it deal with non-file-generating code as easily as files?
    -   E.g. ruffus executing python code
    -   I think not.  The file should be the atomic unit of a pipeline
-   Multiple targets from one recipe
