1.  In the schematic of a PCR reaction below, the base position at one end of each
    primer binding site is indicated.  Both primers are 20 nucleotides long.

    ```
                  F-primer
                 (20 bases)
               |------------
    ...-------------------------------------------------------------...
              800


                                                              3500

                                                    ------------|
                                                      R-primer
                                                     (20 bases)
    ```

    A.  Label the ends of each template strand as 5' and 3'. **[1 point]**

    B.  How long will the resulting PCR amplicon be?  Show your work. **[1 point]**

2.  If you start with 10 copies of the template, how many copies are possible
        after 10 PCR cycles?  Show your work. **[1 point]**

3.  What is the purpose of adding buffer to a PCR mix?  Remember, a buffered
    solution is able to self-regulate pH.  Why is this important for PCR? **[1 point]**

4.  Which of the following short primers will bind most tightly to the template?
    What is your reasoning? **[1 point]**

    ```
        TEMPLATE:       5'-...GGTACCCCTGA...-3'

        PRIMER 1:       5'-GGTACCC-3'

        PRIMER 2:       5'-GGTACCCCTG-3'

        PRIMER 3:       3'-CCATGGG-5'

        PRIMER 4:       3'-CCATGGGG-5'

    ```
