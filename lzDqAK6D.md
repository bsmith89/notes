Meeting with Tom 2015-08-18
=====

Topics:
-   _mcrA_
    -   Clone libraries
    -   Illumina
    -   Why do I want to continue doing these?
    -   What's the question?
    -   Really Tom wants to know "why should anyone else care?"
        -   Does it influence SCFA production?
-   Spending money (in above?)
-   Other gut genes (diversity, abundance, dN/dS)
    -   Can I integrate other genes (e.g. Butyrate Kinase/Transferase, sulfate
        reducer markers, etc.) into this analysis?
    -   SEM with genes, SCFAs?
-   Comparative genomics (transitioning with Ben)
    -   I want to do a module search without a-priori information
    -   Can we relate KOs which are split because of non-homology to find
        _functions_ which correlate with copy number, which we might be losing
        because the KOs don't correlate across major phyla?
        -   Trade-off between (generality and sample-size) and sensitivity
-   dN/dS of antibiotic resistance
-   Longevity data (eventually)
    -   Getting the metadata tomorrow sometime
-   Individual Meetings with committee members
-   NSF demographic reporting on 1027253


## Notes on [@Carbonero2012] ##

-   Three H2 producing pathways (see figure 2)
    -   Only (1) is inhibited by H2
        -   How is this?  Both (1) and (3) enerate H2 through the oxidation of
            Ferredoxin by hydrogenases.
            -   Is there something different about the hydrogenases between
                the two pathways?
            -   Is there a trade-off between inhibition and efficiency, or
                something?
        -   So why is Butyrate production, specifically, reduced in high
            H2 environments?  All of the other fermentation products
            (propionate and acetate, at least) are downstream of that first
            substrate oxidation step...
-   > Less than 20% of carbohydrate remins unabsorbed in people consuming a
    > typical Western diet (citation for this:[@Levitt1987])
    -   This serves as a substrate for fermentation
    -   White rice, apparently, was entirely absorbed (based on H2 production?)
    -   Levitt also found that various fibers (Cellulose, lignin, gum arabic,
        locust bean gum, and pectin) all result in little or no increase in H2
        production (and presumably cannot be degraded?) (see Figure 6)
