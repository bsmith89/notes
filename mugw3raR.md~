2.   Concepts or ideas useful in my science.
    -   Shotgun sequencing:

        Shotgun sequencing is like shredding an
        entire library.
        By googling the fragments of sentences that
        come out of the wood-chipper, you could begin
        to put together a catalog of all the books that
        had been in the library pre-shredding.
        In some cases, you might be able to figure out the
        type of book, even when the correct source is
        elusive.

    -   16S sequencing:

        Similar to shotgun sequencing, except instead of
        shredding everything, you collect the index out of
        every book.
        While many books share a lot of the words in their
        indices, each book is a little bit different.
        You could probably do a pretty good job of figuring
        out the type of book from the index alone, and
        decide what other books are most similar.

    -   Phylogeny:

        A family tree connecting types of organisms to
        their ancienct ancestors.
        By finding out out how many generation back
        you have to go before you have the same grandmother,
        you can also estimate how many heritable diseases
        you'll share, and how similar you'll look.


2.  Jargon for my field.
    -   Community structure: the variety and abundance of species
    -   Resource availability: the amount of food
    -   Gnotobiotic mice: mouse with only the bacteria we intend
    -   Factorial design: every combination of factors
    -   OTU: type of bacteria
