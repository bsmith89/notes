Notes on [@Carbonero2012]

-   Three H2 producing pathways (see figure 2)
    -   Only (1) is inhibited by H2
        -   How is this?  Both (1) and (3) enerate H2 through the oxidation of
            Ferredoxin by hydrogenases.
            -   Is there something different about the hydrogenases between
                the two pathways?
            -   Is there a trade-off between inhibition and efficiency, or
                something?
        -   So why is Butyrate production, specifically, reduced in high
            H2 environments?  All of the other fermentation products
            (propionate and acetate, at least) are downstream of that first
            substrate oxidation step...
-   > Less than 20% of carbohydrate remins unabsorbed in people consuming a
    > typical Western diet (citation for this:[@Levitt1987])
    -   This serves as a substrate for fermentation
    -   White rice, apparently, was entirely absorbed (based on H2 production?)
    -   Levitt also found that various fibers (Cellulose, lignin, gum arabic,
        locust bean gum, and pectin) all result in little or no increase in H2
        production (and presumably cannot be degraded?) (see Figure 6)
