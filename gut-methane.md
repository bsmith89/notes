-   Three H2 producing pathways (see figure 2)
    -   Only (1) is inhibited by H2
        -   How is this?  Both (1) and (3) enerate H2 through the oxidation of
            Ferredoxin by hydrogenases.
            -   Is there something different about the hydrogenases between
                the two pathways?
            -   Is there a trade-off between inhibition and efficiency, or
                something?
        -   So why is Butyrate production, specifically, reduced in high
            H2 environments?  All of the other fermentation products
            (propionate and acetate, at least) are downstream of that first
            substrate oxidation step...

-   > Less than 20% of carbohydrate remins unabsorbed in people consuming a
    > typical Western diet
    -   This serves as a substrate for fermentation
    -   White rice, apparently, was entirely absorbed (based on H2 production?)
    -   Levitt also found that various fibers (Cellulose, lignin, gum arabic,
        locust bean gum, and pectin) all result in little or no increase in H2
        production (and presumably cannot be degraded?) (see Figure 6)

-   > Virtually all children under 5 years of age and 66% of the adult
    > population did not exhale appreciable quantities of CH4
    -   Is this related to physiology of the gut (likely) or lack of colonization?
    -   This does not deviate appreciably from numbers 30 years before.
        -   Does this mean that antibiotic use and changes to diet aren't a big
            deal to methanogens?

-   > The remaining 34% of the adult population had appreciable breath methane
    > concentrations of up to 80 ppm (mean, 15.2 ppm; median, 11.8 ppm).

-   > How-ever, bacterial culture studies subsequently showed that feces of
    > such nonproducers have an average log10 concen- tration of methanogens of
    > 4.9 vs 9.5 in producers.
    -   Therefore the authors think that "non-producers" probably fill out that
        distribution on the low end, and _are_ producing methane, just at
        sub-detectable levels.
