Questions and Hypotheses for Longevity Project

1.  How does ACA affect the microbiome
    -   Community composition
    -   SCFA profile
2.  Does ACA change blood metabolites
3.  Is this change mediated by microbes in the gut?
    -   Transplant study
4.  Dynamics of ACAs effect on the microbiome
    -   How stable are the changes induced by ACA
    -   How long does it take for the effect to be seen?
    -   Does the short-term effect mimic the long-term?
5.  Is the functional (SCFA) effect dependent on the influx of starch, or the
    structure of the community?
    -   Can variability in ACA effect be explained by community structure?
6.  Are there microbial biomarkers of impending mortality?
    -   Might these drive any blood metabolites
    -   Similarly, are there any consistant changes between treatments?
7.  Are transmission dynamics important in determining the effects of ACA
    -   Are there cage-dependent effects of ACA
    -   i.e. Does the metacommunity determine the local effects of treatment
8.  Are changes in the functional profile with ACA treatment more predictable
    than the taxonomic profile?
9.  Do functional changes reflect the predicted changes to the microbial
    food-web?
10. Does ACA have effects on bacterial amylases in the gut?
    -   Do they promote gram-negative growth, since they don't use amylases?
11. Are the effects of ACA analagous to RS?
    -   Treat mice with ACA and RS for short periods and compare the resulting
        community shift.
12. Do any compositional, metabolomic features correlate with longevity?
