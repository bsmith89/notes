#### Principles of Writing/Speaking ####

1.  Communication is the goal.
2.  We're better at editing than we are at writing.
    -   Maybe don't try so hard on individual sentences (at least not the
        first time around)
    -   Organizational structure of the rest of the text is important, and
        makes it easier to see local problems.
    -   Conclusion: Get someone else to edit our work.
    -   Conclusion: Get something on the page quickly.
3.  There are feedback loops between our writing clarity and conceptual
    clarity.
    -   Klings Law of Clarity: There's an inverse relationship between the
        understanding of the author and the clarity of the writing.
4.  "Speaking is writing without re-writes"
    -   Problem: can't form perfect sentences easily.
    -   Problem: Lose track of structure of the talk.
    -   Problem: Vocabulary is worse off-the-cuff
    -   Solution: Pre-write sentences for the talk.
5.  Staying on message is hard.
    -   Clearly delineate message for yourself before the talk.
6.  Science writing can be boring, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
    -   Keep writing "Crayon simple" (no need for sentences to be creative).
    -   The typical reviewer doesn't care that much about your paper.
    -   Science writing is about _information_ not inspiration.
    -   "The world is not ready for the two thought sentence."
        -   If a sentence has more than two thoughts, put a period in.
    -   The thesaurus is the science writer's enemy.
7.  Be precise.
    -   Deliver on the promises you make.
8.  _Every_ sentence is a challenge for the "public" to understand.
    -   They don't have the background/infrastructure/vocabulary.
    -   Meet your audience's needs, not your own needs.
9.  Putting something on paper should flow from big challenges to small challenges.
    1.  Idea
    2.  Organization
    3.  Structure
    4.  Style
10. There are 3 key levels of organization in writing.
    1.  Between paragraph
        -   Put information where it's needed.
    2.  Within paragraphs
        -   Logical structure of paragraphs (?)
    3.  Between sentences
        -   Lead the reader along.

### What to Write ###

E.g. three possible stories about the relative importance of variables:

    1.  A > B
    2.  B < C
    3.  D = E

### Reading Papers ###

To decide what to write, you need to know what's _unknown_.  Given that there
are 1000s of papers in my field, I have to learn how to read papers quickly.

**Hierarchical, iterative method** for reading papers.

Hierarchical
:   Don't understand everything at once

Iterative
:   Return to papers later with a different purpose ((?)does this mean that I
    need a purpose each time I read a paper?)

#### (TD due: 2015-09-14) Read 20 Papers ####

Between now and Monday, I need to read 20 papers using the hierarchical /
iterative method.

-   Choose 20 papers 
-   Rank abstract as "highly relevant", "relevant", or "maybe relevant".
-   Rank introduction as "Excellent", "Good", "Bad".
-   Add key new ref(s) that you found in this paper.
-   Write a 1 sentence conclusion.

### How to form a story from data ###

Given that we know:

-   A > B
-   C > D
-   D = E

How do we turn this into a story?

1.  We need the background ideas (what do other people think/know).
2.  Results from "doing" science.

Which we start with doesn't matter that much, because each one is connected.

How do we break down the research landscape to form the background/"ideas"
part of our story?

How does science advance?

-   "Science operates like a chess board."

    Pawns can move from the back to the front; bishops can make jumps
    diagonally.

    (George's argument is that you want to be at the front.)

-   This metaphor has also been described as the "fan of science".

    Individual advancement is from the root outwards, but new people thinking
    about that idea start moving laterally.

    This can be described for both small and large questions.
    Every advance is answering a standing question and making new questions.
    The fan of progress is based on new questions.
    (This is done by reading the literature, discussions with experts,
    discussions with yourself: _thinking_.)

How do you position yourself at the "front" of scientific advancement?

-   Technology
-   Model systems (kinda like technology)
-   Become an expert in a field that matters
-   Work with brilliant people
-   Be creative
    -   Preparation
    -   Incubation
    -   Intimation
    -   Illumination
    -   Verification

You can filter all science quickly into how they deal with

1.  Time
2.  Space
3.  Variance

(?) But why is the most useful way of dissecting a seminar?  Why are "all"
seminars useful if we think in these terms.

### Structuring an Outline ###

#### Common Elements ####

1.  Abstract or summary
    -   _Follow the instructions_
        -   Name sections the way they were requested.
2.  Introduction
    -   Don't make the reader wait too long.  Let them read shallowly
3.  Research Goals / Questions / Methods / Study Design
4.  (Preliminary) Results
    -   For proposals, these are sometimes in the introduction
5.  Proposed Research / Discussion
6.  Summary / Conclusion
7.  Appendices / Etc.

## 2015-09-16

George recommends avoiding langauge like "we propose to" or "we will attempt"
in a proposal ("X should do Y", too.)

Use simpler words when they are appropriate.
Likewise, simplify the grammar and structure.
"The thesaurus is the scientist's enemy."

Avoid uneccessary modifiers.
(If you're not going to talk about the contrast, avoid using the modifier.)
Instead, use the modifier when it has useful scientific, rhetorical purpose.

### Rules for structuring the organization of your writing.

-   Paragraph to Paragraph:
    -   **Each paragraph's topic sentence should be unique** (no overlap, or you
        should combine).
-   Within a paragraph:
    -   **Concluding sentences should match the topic sentence.**
-   Sentence to sentence:
    -   **Sentences much follow each other logically.**
    -   Use key words with an important meaning to tie sentences together.
        -   This also means that you should probably be repetitive sounding:
            avoid the thesaurus!
    -   Carry through important thoughts.
    -   Lead the reader through your logic from sentence to sentence.
    -   Lead the reader/reviewer by the hand

### Assignment #1 for Next Monday
-   (TD) Send an abstract I've written to my review partner by Saturday at 5pm
    in DOCX format.
-   (TD) Read through my partners abstract and edit it based on the above
    guidelines

### Assignment #2 for Monday
-   (TD) Write the introduction for the outline that I've already turned in

### Assignment #3 for Monday
-   (TD) 20 more papers
