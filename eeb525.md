#### Principles of Writing/Speaking ####

1.  Communication is the goal.
2.  We're better at editing than we are at writing.
    -   Maybe don't try so hard on individual sentences (at least not the
        first time around)
    -   Organizational structure of the rest of the text is important, and
        makes it easier to see local problems.
    -   Conclusion: Get someone else to edit our work.
    -   Conclusion: Get something on the page quickly.
3.  There are feedback loops between our writing clarity and conceptual
    clarity.
    -   Klings Law of Clarity: There's an inverse relationship between the
        understanding of the author and the clarity of the writing.
4.  "Speaking is writing without re-writes"
    -   Problem: can't form perfect sentences easily.
    -   Problem: Lose track of structure of the talk.
    -   Problem: Vocabulary is worse off-the-cuff
    -   Solution: Pre-write sentences for the talk.
5.  Staying on message is hard.
    -   Clearly delineate message for yourself before the talk.
6.  Science writing can be boring, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
    -   Keep writing "Crayon simple" (no need for sentences to be creative).
    -   The typical reviewer doesn't care that much about your paper.
    -   Science writing is about _information_ not inspiration.
    -   "The world is not ready for the two thought sentence."
        -   If a sentence has more than two thoughts, put a period in.
    -   The thesaurus is the science writer's enemy.
7.  Be precise.
    -   Deliver on the promises you make.
8.  _Every_ sentence is a challenge for the "public" to understand.
    -   They don't have the background/infrastructure/vocabulary.
    -   Meet your audience's needs, not your own needs.
9.  Putting something on paper should flow from big challenges to small challenges.
    1.  Idea
    2.  Organization
    3.  Structure
    4.  Style
10. There are 3 key levels of organization in writing.
    1.  Between paragraph
        -   Put information where it's needed.
    2.  Within paragraphs
        -   Logical structure of paragraphs (?)
    3.  Between sentences
        -   Lead the reader along.

## What to Write ##

E.g. three possible stories about the relative importance of variables:

    1.  A > B
    2.  B < C
    3.  D = E

### Reading Papers ###

To decide what to write, you need to know what's _unknown_.  Given that there
are 1000s of papers in my field, I have to learn how to read papers quickly.

**Hierarchical, iterative method** for reading papers.

Hierarchical
:   Don't understand everything at once

Iterative
:   Return to papers later with a different purpose ((?)does this mean that I
    need a purpose each time I read a paper?)

#### (TD due: 2015-09-14) Read 20 Papers ####

Between now and Monday, I need to read 20 papers using the hierarchical /
iterative method.

-   Choose 20 papers 
-   Rank abstract as "highly relevant", "relevant", or "maybe relevant".
-   Rank introduction as "Excellent", "Good", "Bad".
-   Add key new ref(s) that you found in this paper.
-   Write a 1 sentence conclusion.
