UNH Wrap-up

-   Went quite smoothly
-   >90% Windows (quite the opposite of Stanford)
-   >50% Matlab users (many proficient)
    -   NumPy for Matlab users was very applicable for this audience
    -   Could we motivate a Python lesson with the advantages over matlab?
        -   FOSS
        -   Vibrant community / Stack-overflow
-   Lots of people that know each other (resulting in an engaged, vocal audience)
-   Learners seemed interested, motivated to learn the material
    -   Several learners were faculty, but otherwise mostly PhD students,
        primarily in engineering (ocean engineering)
